-- Exercise 2.18 [â˜…] We usually represent a sequence of values as a list. In this representation, it is easy to move
-- from one element in a sequence to the next, but it is hard to move from one element to the preceding one without the
-- help of context arguments. Implement non-empty bidirectional sequences of integers, as suggested by the grammar
--
-- NodeInSequence ::= (Int Listof(Int) Listof(Int))
--
-- The first list of numbers is the elements of the sequence preceding the current one, in reverse order, and the second
-- list is the elements of the sequence after the current one. For example, (6 (5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9)) represents the list
-- (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9), with the focus on the element 6.
--
-- In this representation, implement the procedure number->sequence, which takes a number and produces a sequence
-- consisting of exactly that number. Also implement current-element, move-to-left, move-to-right, insert-to-left,
-- insert-to-right, at-left-end?, and at-right-end?.
--
-- For example:
--
--     > (number->sequence 7)
--     (7 () ())
--     > (current-element '(6 (5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9)))
--     6
--     > (move-to-left '(6 (5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9)))
--     (5 (4 3 2 1) (6 7 8 9))
--     > (move-to-right '(6 (5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9)))
--     (7 (6 5 4 3 2 1) (8 9))
--     > (insert-to-left 13 '(6 (5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9)))
--     (6 (13 5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9))
--     > (insert-to-right 13 '(6 (5 4 3 2 1) (7 8 9)))
--     (6 (5 4 3 2 1) (13 7 8 9))
--
-- The procedure move-to-right should fail if its argument is at the right end of the sequence, and the procedure
-- move-to-left should fail if its argument is at the left end of the sequence.
